# BC: coverage — Domain Exploration

This BC models RF propagation, pathloss, and coverage simulation.

Open Questions:
- Which RF models will the project support first?
  (Free-space? 3GPP 38.901 UMa/UMi?)
- What inputs does propagation need from terrain?
- How should we represent a CoverageMap?
- Do we need fading/shadow models now or later?
- How will we validate propagation outputs?
- What are the precision requirements?
