# BC: siting — Domain Exploration

This BC contains the decision logic: constraints, scoring, selection, and candidate generation.

Open Questions:
- How do we define a CandidateSite?
- What constraints matter first? (legal, physical, economic?)
- How will we integrate zoning or urban restrictions?
- How should scoring be calculated?
- What constitutes a "good" or "bad" site?
- Which outputs should siting produce?
